      <p class="bio">
       I'm a Web Designer, based out of Nashville, TN. I received my B.S. in Information Technology and Graphic Media. After spending a few years as a designer working closely with other developers, I became interested in pursuing devolopment for myself.
        <br /> </br>
        My upbringing isn't as linear as some. I moved overseas at the age of 10, and spent almost nine years living in Turkey. I moved back to the state for college and have moved around a handful of times since then. Growing up overseas gave me an invaluable perspective of the world, and a variety of cultural experiences I will hold on to and reference in the years ahead.  
        When I'm not working, I spend a decent amount of my free time hiking, running, and traveling.
